# WP Theme - New Version

This repository is for the development of a new version of the current WP theme. The goal is to create a lighter theme with only the basic requirements needed to set up a project. This includes a focus on simplicity, maintainability, and leveraging Gutenberg blocks for future builds.

---

## Goals for the New Theme

### General Features
- **Lighter Base Theme**: Focus on minimalism and essential features only.
- **Basic Stylesheets and Templates**: Provide a foundation for project setup.
- **Future Compatibility**: Utilize Gutenberg blocks for layout and functionality.

### Styling
- Use **fresh SASS** for maintainable and modular styles.
- **No Page-Specific Styling**: Avoid adding styles tailored to individual pages.
- Remove JSON styling and instead rely on **Gutenberg’s global styling options**.

### Components
- Move functionality like sliders and other reusable components to **WP Blocks** instead of embedding them in the main theme.
- Keep component styling **simple** and **easily adaptable** for future projects.

## Editor Goals
- Ensure the **WordPress editor** reflects the frontend layout to make content editing intuitive for clients.

---

## To Be Investigated
- **SEO Metadata**:  
  - Raivis added an additional metadata box for SEO purposes.  
  - Check with Max or the appropriate digital team member whether this is still needed, or if the **Yoast SEO** boxes are sufficient.

This theme is intended to streamline workflows, improve maintainability, and enhance client usability. Further updates will be made as development progresses.
